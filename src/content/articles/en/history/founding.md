# The Founding of Derrenomo


Long ago, in a Minecraft world far, far away. Somebody forgot Aternos' 3 month non-start limit.
So the old server got erased.
My friends and I, the author, decided to create a new server!
So gave the new server a new name (DunamosMP2), and we logged onto it.

Now, we decided to split up our bases, into fictional "nations". And thus, **Derrenomo** was born.

## What is Derrenomo?

This deserves its own article, but simply put, it is a dictatorship in the form of a centralized
presidential republic. The capital city is the *City of Derrenomo*, and the country is split into either
prefectures and cities.

There are 5 official languages
- English
- Indonesian
- Japanese
- Mandarin (Simplified)
- Italian
